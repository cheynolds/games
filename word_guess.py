# Word Guessing

"""
File: word_guess.py
-------------------
When the user plays WordGuess, the computer first selects a secret
word at random from a list built into the program. The program then 
prints out a row of dashesâ€”one for each letter in the secret word 
and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter 
that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances 
of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any 
letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does 
not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. 
The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has 
correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the user 
has made eight incorrect guesses.
